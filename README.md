# Video Transcript Automation

## Overview
The Video Transcript Automation project is designed to automatically generate transcripts from video files. It leverages advanced speech recognition technologies to convert spoken content into text, streamlining the process of creating accurate and efficient transcripts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3.7+**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **FFmpeg**: A multimedia framework used for handling video and audio processing.
- **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**: Provides powerful speech recognition capabilities to convert audio to text.
- **Pydub**: A library for audio processing in Python, used to manipulate audio files.
- **MoviePy**: A Python library for video editing, used to extract audio from video files.

## üîç Process Overview

### 1. Video Input
- Videos are provided in various formats (e.g., MP4, AVI).
- The system supports batch processing, allowing multiple videos to be transcribed simultaneously.

### 2. Audio Extraction
- **FFmpeg** is used to extract audio tracks from video files.
- The extracted audio is saved in a suitable format (e.g., WAV) for further processing.

### 3. Audio Preprocessing
- **Pydub** is used to manipulate the audio, such as adjusting volume levels or splitting long audio files into smaller segments.
- Preprocessing ensures the audio quality is optimal for speech recognition.

### 4. Speech Recognition
- The preprocessed audio is sent to the **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API**.
- The API processes the audio and returns a text transcript of the spoken content.
- The system handles different languages and dialects, depending on the API's capabilities.

### 5. Transcript Generation
- The returned text is formatted into a structured transcript.
- Time-stamping can be added to the transcript to indicate when specific parts of the audio occur.

### 6. Output
- The final transcript is saved in a text file or other desired formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX).
- Transcripts can be customized to include speaker identification if supported by the API.

### 7. Continuous Improvement
- The system can be updated to incorporate new features or improve accuracy based on user feedback and advancements in speech recognition technology.

## Conclusion
The Video Transcript Automation project simplifies the process of generating transcripts from video content. By automating audio extraction and leveraging powerful speech recognition tools, it provides an efficient solution for creating accurate transcripts.
